Binary is a high-performance binary serialization library for Go, specifically designed for TinyGo compatibility. It's an adaptation of the [Kelindar/binary](https://github.com/Kelindar/binary) project, optimized for resource-constrained environments and embedded systems.

## Features

- **TinyGo Compatible**: Designed to work seamlessly with TinyGo compiler
- **High Performance**: Efficient binary encoding/decoding with minimal allocations
- **Type Safe**: Compile-time type checking with reflection-based runtime support
- **Extensible**: Custom codec support through the `Codec` interface
- **Memory Efficient**: Object pooling for encoders and decoders

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/tinywasm/binary
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/tinywasm/binary"
)

// Define a struct to serialize
type User struct {
    Name    string  
    Age     int     
    Active  bool    
    Balance float64 
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance
    user := &User{
        Name:    "Alice",
        Age:     30,
        Active:  true,
        Balance: 123.45,
    }

    // Create Binary instance
    tb := binary.New()

    // Encode to binary
    data, err := tb.Encode(user)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Decode from binary
    var decoded User
    err = tb.Decode(data, &decoded)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    printf("Decoded: %+v\n", decoded)
}
```
